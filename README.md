# Nano ID Collision Calculator [![Cult Of Martians][cult-img]][cult]

> https://alex7kom.github.io/nano-nanoid-cc/

[Nano ID](https://github.com/ai/nanoid) is a unique string ID generator for JavaScript and [other languages](https://github.com/ai/nanoid#other-programming-languages).

As any other ID generator Nano ID has a probability of generating the same ID twice, i.e. producing a collision.

The purpose of this calculator is to find ID length for chosen alphabet safe enough to avoid collisions.
